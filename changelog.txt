Version: 1.7.0
Date: 2025-07-01
  Features:
    - Added shortcut button to toggle tech switching on or off. Removed setting for "disable mod until X".
    - Added lower threshold for science packs shared by all techs in queue, so that tech-switching still works if a lower-tier science pack is the bottleneck.
  Optimizations:
    - Cache list of labs per-surface; when lab is created/destroyed, only invalidate and rebuild cache for that surface instead of searching all surfaces.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.6.1
Date: 30. 06. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when lab spoilage goes to science pack inventory because spoilage inventory is full.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.6.0
Date: 21. 06. 2025
  Compatibility:
    - Added compatibility for modded labs that only allow some types of science packs.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed bug where missing science packs were reported as "(error)" when "prioritize late game science" is enabled and the mod switches away from techs that have early-game science packs not in the new tech.
    - Ignore frozen labs (e.g. on Cerys) when checking science pack availability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.0
Date: 22. 02. 2025
  Features:
    - When using settings to prioritize spoilable and late-game sciences together, techs that both have spoilable sciences will use late-game sciences as a tie-breaker, using method suggested by Matrix_V. Option to prioritize late-game sciences will now use tech's other sciences as tie-breakers.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed bug where labs cache didn't update when labs were built by space platforms or other mods.
    - Changed global to storage. Might prevent multiplayer desyncs though no issues have been reported.

Date: 09. 02. 2025

Version: 1.4.0
Date: 06. 01. 2025
  Features:
    - Added option to move techs to the back of the queue when they're switched away from, instead of moving them to second place.
  Translation:
    - Added AI-generated translations for Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean.
  Changes:
    - Increased default science-available threshold from 0.5 to 0.8, should reduce thrashing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.1
Date: 14. 12. 2024
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix crash when labs become invalid. (Crash seems to happen in multiplayer with other mods; could not reproduce it but this probably fixes it.)
