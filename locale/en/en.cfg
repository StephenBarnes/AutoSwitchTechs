[mod-setting-description]
AutoSwitchTechs-run-every-n-seconds=How often the mod should check and adjust the tech queue.
AutoSwitchTechs-prioritize-spoilable-science=If enabled, switch to techs with spoilable science packs when they're in stock, to use up the spoilable science first.
AutoSwitchTechs-prioritize-late-game-science=If enabled, switch to techs using late-game science packs when they're in stock. This prioritizes promethium science over Aquilo science over Vulcanus/Gleba/Fulgora science, and those sciences over earlier sciences in order (space, yellow+purple, blue, military, green, red). If you enable both this and the option to prioritize spoilable sciences, the spoilable science priority will supersede this.
AutoSwitchTechs-science-available-threshold=If this fraction of your labs has a science pack in stock, it's considered available. You will only switch to a tech if all of its science packs are available.
AutoSwitchTechs-show-warnings=When the research queue is empty, or no techs in the queue have enough science packs available, show a warning message.
AutoSwitchTechs-move-to-back=When auto-switching to a new tech, move the old tech from the front of the research queue to the back of the queue instead of second place. This can help avoid situations where the mod switches between the front few techs which are all starved for science packs. (Caveat: If some techs in the queue have prerequisites also in the queue, the front tech will instead be moved to right before the first tech with prerequisites in the queue.)
